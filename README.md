Applied Statistical Modeling of Wine Reviews

Data used: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

Objective:

- use of Bayesian Statistics for comparison of different group of wines:

  • data preprocessing using Tidyverse;

  • exploring and visualizing the data using ggplot;
  
  • Estimate model parameters using a Gibbs sampler;
  
  • Assess the sampler performance visually;
  
  • Interpret the model output.
 
 - fit a linear regression model focusing on frequentist inference
 
  • data preprocessing and EDA including imputation of missing data
  
  • deriving new fields of data using existing data columns
  
  • selection of important features using Boruta and stepwise linear regression
  
  • comparison of different models using AIC/BIC and different error metrics.
